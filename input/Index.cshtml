        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
            Growing up in New Jersey and Florida I graduated with an <a
                href="https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/">IB diploma</a> from Stanton College Preparatory
            School in 2003. I headed off to the Georgia Institute of Technology and got out with a BS in Computer
            Engineering in 2006, magna cum laude.
        </p>
        <p>
            I co-founded and was a partner / owner at iMobile3 (now <a href="https://www.vitalpos.com">Vital</a>), a
            mobile payments company. We were acquired by TSYS, now <a href="https://www.globalpaymentsinc.com/">Global
                Payments</a>, in June 2018.
        </p>
        <p>After a successful transition I left Global and am now an engineering manager at <a
                href="https://www.olo.com/">Olo</a> using my knowledge of customer loyalty and payments processing. We
            went public in March 2021.</p>
